# How to Read Research Papers

## When Pick Up a New Area
1. Compile list of papers (research papers, Medium posts, GitHub posts)
2. Skip around list
    - Read 10% for each paper and decide which one to keep on and which one to give up
    - Find more papers based on the seminal one
3. 5~20 papers give you a rough understanding of one area
4. 50~100 papers give you a very good understanding

## How to Read One Paper
Take multiple passes through the paper
1. Title / Abstract / Figures
2. Introduction / Conclusion / Figures again / Skim the rest
(skim / skip the related work, for unfamiliar areas the related works may be hard to understand)
3. Read the paper but skip / skim the math
4. Read the whole thing, but skip the parts that don't make sense

## Questions to Keep in Mind
1. What did the authors try to accomplish?
2. What were the key elements of the approach?
3. What can you use yourself?
4. What other references do you want to follow?

## How to Get Papers
1. Twitter
2. Subreddit
3. Conferences
4. [PaperWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/)
4. Friends

## How to Understand Deeply
1. Math
    - Read through the paper, and rederive it from scratch by yourself
2. Code
    - Run open source code
    - Reimplement it from scratch
